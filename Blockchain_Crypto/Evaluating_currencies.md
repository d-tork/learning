1. **Founder references**: find out about the team, because they are the constant. The product and
market are the variables. 
2. **Opportunity size**: what is the market size now, and how big could it become?
3. **Use the product**
4. **Talk to users**: i.e. on discord, how did you hear about the product? What were you using 
before? How does it compare to alternatives? What would make you churn? Look for organic and 
durable usage. 
5. **Traction analysis**: look at the public project data (on-chain especially) and look for 
growth KPIs. Compare to competitors. 
6. **Why now**: why have past attempts failed? What is different now or about this one? 
7. **Community review**: join the discord and telegram to assess the quality of members. Use
twitteraudit.com to get the human-to-bot ratio of followers. 
8. **Tokens and value accrual**: understand the high-level token mechanics. 
9. **Competitive landscaping**: who are the top competitors, and how is this one different? 
10. **Returns analysis**: make sure the math makes sense (with https://messari.io)
