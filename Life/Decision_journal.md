> **The way to test the quality of your decisions is to test the process by which you make them.**

## Kahneman's advice
Whenever you're making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just:
1. take a moment to think
2. write down what you expect to happen
3. why you expect it to happen 
4. (Optional) write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and emotionally

It's to get you accurate and honest feedback on **what you were thinking at the time you made the
decision.** This feedback helps you to see when you were stupid and lucky, as well as when you
were smart and unlucky.
