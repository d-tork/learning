# Knowledge Management

## _Lean Knowledge Management_ (Roger Forsgren)

### Definitions
> Knowledge: Critical information that can be embodied in lessons learned, case studies, advice, 
> know-how, training courses, and best practices that can make your customer's job easier or more 
> efficient or more productive.
> 
> KM: Consists of three primary phases: 
> 	- Gathering: discovering where potential pockets of knowledge may be located, or even hidden
> 	- Filtering: determining which components you gathered is usable and helpful to your 
> 	customers. There's tons of _information_ out there, but it doesn't become _knowledge_ until 
> 	you filter out the components that your customers need 
> 	- Sharing: finding the most effective way to disseminate this knowledge

### The Lessons Learned (LL) database
> The quickest and most customary way to gather and catalog knowledge is by developing an internal 
> lessons learned database.

* develop a simple-to-use template where employees can share info and describe their learning 
experience
* it is important that all submissions to the LL go through a review or vetting process ensuring 
they are indeed pertinent and applicable as well as organized by topic
* the database software must have a search function
* crucial to make your LL database easy to use and easy to locate; it should be / probably will be
the first place an employee looks when researching a problem

#### An example
**Abstract** - _A short summary describing the proposed lesson learned. This allows the reader to
quickly determine if this lesson learned is applicable to his/her situation._
> Consideration for strain relief on wiring bundles during the design phase is essential for 
> product reliability and hardware robustness. Designers may be unaware...

**Suggest key searchable words** - _Necessary to make the lesson learned searchable in a database. 
Use as many appropriate searchable words as possible to ensure a reader may locate it._
> Strain relief; bundling wires; wire sheathing; electromagnetic interference; good design practices

**Description of Problem/Situation** - _The Who, what, why, when, and how._

**Conclusion** - _The actions taken to solve the problem or issue along with recommendations to 
prevent its occurrence in the future._
> Special brackets had to be fabricated and installed to provide proper strain relief...

### Subject Matter Database
> A good KM program knows where to find the subject matter experts within its organization. 
> Compiling a searchable list of names and contact information can provide easy and quick access 
> to someone who has the expertise to solve problems. 

## Practices
### Publish sidebar conversations
Encourage people to ask their questions of you in a more public forum (company
Slack, Confluence page) so everyone benefits from both the question and the 
answer. 

If you don't/can't _start_ with that, then take emails or chats where you've
answered a question and publish it to one of those forums (with their 
permission of course).
