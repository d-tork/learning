# _How to Measure Anything_ (Hubbard)

## 4 Useful Measurement Assumptions
1. It's been measured before.
2. You have far more data than you think.
3. You need far less data than you think.
4. Useful, new observations are more accessible than you think. 

## Applied Information Economics (AIE)
1. Define the decision
2. Determine what you know now
3. Compute the value of additional information. (If none, go to step 5.)
4. Measure where information value is high. (Return to steps 2 and 3 until further measurement is 
not needed.)
5. Make a decision and act on it. (Return to step 1 and repeat as each action creates new decisions.)

## Ordinal Scales, and their misuse
It is common for organizations to use ordinal scales (e.g. 4-star ratings) in some sort of 
"weighted score" to evaluate alternatives in a decision. This often involves operations that are 
technically invalid for ordinal scales (multiplication and addition) and the evidence about the 
performance of these methods (i.e., whether they measurable improve decisions) is either 
non-existent or negative. Using numbers alone doesn't make a weighted score a measurement. It must 
reduce uncertainty and for that uncertainty reduction to be valuable it must improve some decision.
